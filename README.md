# Car racing game (WIP)

## Game may be played here: [https://nicholas-riegel.github.io/racing-game/](https://nicholas-riegel.github.io/racing-game/)

While ChatGPT gave me the ideas for much of this code (as I do not know much about how to move divs and create animations in js, which is the main reason I wanted to do this project), ChatGPT's answers had to be heavily adapted and the answers from several queries combined to get the effect I wanted. The recursive use of the requestAnimationFrame function was key to getting the smooth movement of the players car.
